		Hives is virtual paths and maps to the associated application library and library list.
		Good practice is to keep a special char in the hive name (i.e. a dash) so it will not be
		confused by at physical path in the IFS. The hive path can point to any path
		on the IFS - also out of the server root path. This can be used to map to
		QNTC files on a Windows server or via a mounted NFS volume on a AIX, Linux,
		Mac, Win or NAS-disk for images, PDF resources etc.

		mime types maps the files suffix with the content type required in the HTTP protocol.

		Keep this list optimized with only used mime types in you application  ( don't bloat this list !!)
		Used but unlisted mime-types will occur as warnings in the joblog

		Note: We can force the charset to "nothing" by setting the charset to blank. This can be used fot binary transfered files
